Bhagavan within
the Heart of a Bhakta
一位奉献者心中的薄伽梵
 
3
00:00:07,444 --> 00:00:09,777
When Bhagavan
Krishna said
当薄伽梵奎师那对

4
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:14,266
to Radharani that He doesn�t understand
that love, you see, He is Love Himself,
罗陀罗妮说祂不理解那种爱 你瞧 祂是在爱自己

5
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:22,311
so which means devotees
are different from the Lord,
所以那意味着弟子是不同于神的

6
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:29,466
he plays a different role in itself, you know.
A devotee plays the role of service.
他本身扮演者不同的角色  弟子扮演者服务的角色

7
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:33,533
So, here it's reminding
that the Atma in itself
所以 这里提醒内在的阿特玛
 

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,777
from the beginning itself has an attitude
of service: the lover and the beloved.
在一开始要有一种服务的态度：爱者和至尊主
 
9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,355
So, in a state of serving
He incarnates as bhakta.
所以 在服务的状态中 祂化身为奉献者
 
10
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:57,844
Like He said, "I incarnate in three
aspects". What are the three aspects?

Himself and bhakta] and bhakta.

14
00:01:17,933 --> 00:01:25,044
So, He incarnates in three aspects
which are scriptures, Bhagavan, bhakta.
所以 祂显化在三个方面 圣典 薄伽梵 奉献者
 
15
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,155
So, first is bhakta,
所以 首先是奉献者
 
16
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:33,355
because without bhakta, Bhagavan
and scriptures are not there.
因为没有奉献者 薄伽梵和圣典不会出现

17
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:38,777

a bhakta. Understand.

Without being a bhakta,

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,020
the scriptures would not exist
and Bhagavan would not exist.
圣典不会存在 薄伽梵不会存在

20
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,844
So, first is bhakta.
所以 首先是奉献者

21
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:58,044
So, to become a bhakta, to become
a devotee of God is not that easy.
所以 去成为一个奉献者 去成为一个神的弟子不是那么容易的

what they feel, "Okay God, I like
God to be the way I want Him to be."

object, you know.

36
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:08,066
It's that essence
of God inside.

00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:14,600
So, to love God
is not an easy thing.

38
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:17,600

我们可以说 是的 我们爱神 但是你是否是出于想见祂而爱祂呢

39
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:24,777
Eventually. If you tell
somebody to love someone,
到头来 如果你告诉某人你爱他

00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:55,222
Then they say,

As long as that
mind is active,

00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:20,888
is jumping always into the
external starts to jump inside.

This is the time where the mind
goes into the heart and opens up.

00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:32,044
Then only,
you feel the love.

64
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:37,622
And once you feel that
love, it is ever growing.
并且一旦你感受到那爱 它不断增长

65
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:42,570
You know, it's not a love that today
is here, tomorrow is not there and
你知道 它不是那种今天存在的 明天就不在那里的爱

it keeps changing, you know,
and say, "Oh, I like that person."

67
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,133
Like and love are
two different things.
喜欢和爱是俩个不同的东西

68
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,111
You have to understand what is love.
Love is something which keeps growing,
你必须理解什么事爱 爱是某种保持增长的东西

69
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,088
it doesn't finish.
它不会结束

70
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,266
Nowadays you see people say, "Yes, I love
you, I love you" for personal interest only.
今天你看见人们说 是的 我爱你 我爱你 仅仅是为了个人爱好

71
00:06:02,377 --> 00:06:08,000
Just to fulfil their self-interest, you know,
they say, "I love you, I love you".
仅仅是为了完成他们的个人兴趣 你知道的 他们说 我爱你 我爱你

very enthusiasm into that love, you know,

00:06:28,822 --> 00:06:31,533
you hear it in the voice
itself of that person,
你听到那个人自己的声音

76
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:38,422
how it diminishes.
This is emotion only.
它是怎么减小的 这只是情感

77
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,800
People confuse
emotion with love
人们把情感和爱混为一谈

78
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:48,466
because love is
not that emotion.
因为爱不是那情感

79
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,822
So, when Krishna
said to Radha,
所以当奎师那对圣女罗陀罗妮说

80
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:56,311
"I will incarnate in the
heart of the bhakta",
我将化身在奉爱瑜伽行者的心中

81
00:06:56,777 --> 00:06:59,577
what He said is that,
"I shall awake,
那是祂说的 我将要

82
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:03,444
you know, those who
long for Me shall feel Me
那些渴望我的人将要感知到我

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,377
and through that feeling inside,
their heart shall open up.
和通过那内在的感受 他们的心将会被打开

84
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:11,933
Their mind shall come
to a point of surrender.
他们的头脑将会到达臣服的点

85
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,555
Their mind doesn't jump,
the mind doesn't: today it is
他们的头脑不会跳跃 他们的头脑不会 今天

86
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:18,222
very joyful, tomorrow
it's down completely."
是非常高兴的 明天就完全沮丧了

87
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:22,755
You see that every day in daily life.
Today you have people which are,
在日常生活中每天 今天这个人是

88
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:25,711
"Oh, yes, beautiful!",
due to a certain
哦 是的 美丽 因为某种

89
00:07:27,444 --> 00:07:31,711
experience, you know, they are very,
"Aaaah", flying around, you know,
经验 他们非常 啊哈 飞来飞去

90
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:38,044
don't have feet on the
ground and then tomorrow

91
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,777
is different. Tomorrow they
wake up with their left foot.
是不同的 明天 他们醒来只有一直左脚了

92
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:53,333
So, one day it is very joyful, the next
day it is catastrophe completely.
所以 第一天是非常高兴的 隔一天就完全是灾难了

93
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:57,666
What has changed?
Nothing!
什么改变了吗 没有

94
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:04,755
You see, here this is how the mind functions.
Like I always say, it's like a dog,
你瞧 这就是头脑如何运作的 它像一只狗

95
00:08:05,377 --> 00:08:09,733
you know, you give a dog a nice
� how say � you beat the dog,
你给一只狗 你打一只狗

96
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:14,822
the dog will look at you
very angrily and goes away.
狗会很愤怒的看着你并离开

97
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:19,377
Then the same few
minutes later you give
接着几分钟后你给

98
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:25,555
bones to the dog, you know, the dog
will wag his tale and run towards you.
骨头给那个狗 狗会摇动它的尾巴并向你跑来

99
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:30,400
And the next moment again you
beat the dog, again the same thing.
同时下一时刻你打这个狗 同样的事也会发生

100
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:35,400
So, this is such a state of the mind.
The mind doesn't have any
所以 这就是头脑的状态 头脑不会有任何

101
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:41,444
focus where it will say, "Yes, I want to
grow, I want to surrender, I want to..."
焦点它会说 是的 我想要成长 我想要臣服 我想要

102
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:45,933
That's the difference
between people which are
这就是这个物质世界的人和

103
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:49,822
into the world and people
which are on the spiritual path.
走在灵性道路上的人的不同

104
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,755
In the spiritual path, it gives you a certain
understanding that where your mind must be.
在灵性道路上 它给予你某种头脑必须在哪里的认识

105
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:00,066
Where your mind is,
your heart will run there.
你头脑所在的地方 你的心会跑向那

106
00:09:00,866 --> 00:09:07,311
You see that: if your mind is
on your problem, what is your state?
你知道那 如果你的头脑在你问题上 你是什么状态

107
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:11,888
Can you feel your heart? Can you feel
that love? Can you feel that joy?
你能感受到你的心吗 你能感受到那爱吗 你能感受到那喜悦吗

108
00:09:12,777 --> 00:09:13,880
No, you can't,
不 你不能

109
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,222
because you are
so much focused on that
因为你太专注于那

110
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,800
which is limited, things
which are bothering you.
受限制的 打扰你的东西

111
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,222
But if your mind is on God, that mind transforms
itself. You see, that's why Krishna said, you know,
但是如果你的头脑在神上 那头脑转化它自己 那就是为什么奎师那说

112
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:34,155
"Surrender that mind to Me,
I shall take care of it."
把头脑交给我 我会照顾好它

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,111
So, surrender that mind,
is transforming that mind from
所以 放弃那头脑

114
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,244
a limitation mind
into Divine.
就是从一个有限制的头脑到神的转化

115
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:50,200
Everything is limited.
You are made up of matter.
每个物体都是有限制的 你是物体组成的

116
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,644
This body is made up of matter, no? It is limited.
That mind is made up of matter, it's limited.
这个身体是物体组成的 不是吗 它是有限制的 那头脑是物质组成的 它是有限制的

117
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:02,955
So, body,
mind is limited.
所以 身体 头脑是有限制的

118
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:10,333
So, what is inside of you this is
unlimited one. Your soul is unlimited.
所以 你内在东西这个是无限制的 你的灵魂是无限制的

119
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:17,022
That's why the scriptures,
in all the scriptures it's said
那就是为什么经典 在所有经典中它说道

120
00:10:17,488 --> 00:10:22,244
you are that Atma, you are
that soul, that spark of God
你是阿特玛 你是那灵魂 神的火花

121
00:10:23,555 --> 00:10:25,266
and that's what
you shall be.
那是你将成为的样子

122
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:31,333
How many times have been reminded, how
many lives you have been reminded of that?
你有多少次被提醒 多少世被提醒着那

123
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Many lives, many
times, but yet, due to
很多世 很多次 但是然而 因为

124
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:44,733
normality, due to
? how say ? routine,
停滞不前 因为日常生活

125
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:48,311
you still think that,
"I will find happiness."
你仍然认为我将找到幸福

126
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:52,711
You are still looking for true happiness,
you are still looking for that love.
你仍然在寻找那真正的幸福 你仍然在寻找那真正的爱

127
00:10:52,977 --> 00:10:57,755
This is your true identity. Your true identity
it is parcel of that love and, of course,
这是你真正的身份 你真正的身份是那爱的一部分 当然

128
00:10:58,044 --> 00:11:02,377
that part of love which is inside
of you, of course, longs for
爱的一部分在你里面 当然 渴望

129
00:11:03,422 --> 00:11:05,377
something great, no?
