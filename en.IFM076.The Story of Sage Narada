1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,840
昨天我在答善上讲过的 讲述了那罗陀的故事
Yesterday I was talking in the Darshan,
I was telling the story of Narada,

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:22,730
当毗耶娑写完17首史诗后仍然有怀疑
how when Vyasa had
the doubt after writing 17 Puranas,

3
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,930
他仍旧不满足
he still was not satisfied.

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,060
他写了16首 接着他写下了博伽瓦谭
He wrote the 16, then he
wrote the Bhagavatam,

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,970
他写下了毗湿奴史诗等等 但是他不满足
he wrote Vishnu Purana
and so on, but he was not satisfied.

6
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:37,860
所以 那罗陀来的他身边并对他说
So, Narada came
to him and told him,

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,570
来 我告诉我是如何通过奉爱去书写的  因为奉爱不是你认为的那么简单
"Look, I’ll tell you my – write on bhakti,
because bhakti is not as simple as you think it is."

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,000
你认为你在奉爱的道路上 是的
You think that you are
in Bhakti Marga, "Yes,

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,820
我讲获得神 我将得到祂 这一世后我将和祂在一起 不 它不是那么容易的
I will attain God, I will receive Him, I will be
with Him after this life." No, it’s not that easy.

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,680
那罗陀讲述了他第一世的故事
So, Narada told the story how
when he was born first time,

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:06,510
他的母亲是一个佣人
his mother was a servant
and he was serving

12
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:15,260
他通过母亲的服务在服务 她给了他好的业力  好的教育
through – the mother was serving, but she had
given good samskaras to him, good education,

13
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,480
如何爱神 如何记住神
how to love God
and how to remember God.

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,060
所以 在他四岁的时候 一些苦行僧来到他的地方 母亲在服务他们
So, at the age of four some sadhu came
to his place, the mother was serving.

15
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,040
他意识到其中有一位苦行僧 这人是我的古鲁
So, in the sadhu he realised
that, "This man is my Guru."

16
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,240
那罗陀认识到那 这人是我的古鲁 我应该从他那得到启引 我应该臣服于他
Narada realised that, "This man is my Guru. I should
take diksha from him. I should surrender to him."

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,710
所以 他向他的母亲请求允许 他离开家 与苦行僧一起生活四个月
So, he asked permission from his mother.
He went and lived with the sadhu for four months.

18
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:51,110
起初 住下几天 三天后他请求 摩诃拉嘉 请启引我
And at the beginning, few days he was staying, after
three days he asked, "Maharaj, please initiate me!"

19
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,040
摩诃拉嘉说 你才四岁 我该如何启引你呢
Maharaj said, "You are four
years old, how can I initiate you?

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,600
我能给你什么 他说 请仅给我古鲁颂歌 我将服务您
What can I give you?" He said, "Please,
just give me Guru Mantra. I will serve you."

21
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:08,000
所以 他在那罗延那的圣名中被启引
So, he was initiated in
the Name of Narayana.

22
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,840
那就是为什么无论何时你看到那罗陀穆尼
That’s why Narada Muni
whenever you see him,

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,200
他总是念诵着一个名字 那罗延 那罗延 那罗延 无它
he always chants only one Name,
"Narayan, Narayan, Narayan", nothing else.

24
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,100
在他被启引后 服务他的古鲁四个月后
So, after he got initiated,
four months he served his Guru.

25
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,910
他日日夜夜念诵着 没有一刻他不念诵
Night and day he chanted. There was
not a single moment that he didn’t chant.

26
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,240
你瞧 当我告诉你去念诵 16圈念珠是头痛的事
You see, you, when I tell you to chant,
16 rounds of a mala is headache.

27
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,080
你甚至每天16圈都完不成
You don’t even finish
16 rounds per day.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,640
那罗陀 日日夜夜 每当他沉睡时 古鲁会踢他并说
Narada, night and day, whenever he would
fall asleep, the Guru would kick him and say,

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,370
那罗陀 你正在干什么 接着他会说 那罗延 那罗延 那罗延
"Narada, what are you doing?" Then he
would say, "Narayan, Narayan, Narayan."

30
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:54,530
四个月 日日夜夜他没有睡觉 只是念诵那罗延
Four months, night and day he didn’t
sleep, just chanting of Narayana.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,440
四个月后 他必须回去 他的古鲁送他回家
After four months, he had to go back,
his Guru sent him back to home,

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,510
他没有感受到回家 他说 那不是我的地方 我的家在古鲁的莲足旁
so, he didn’t feel at home. He said, "That’s
not my place. My place is at my Guru’s Feet".

33
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,840
这位嘉伽德古鲁 这位萨特古鲁 当然
So, this Jagadguru,
this Satguru, of course,

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,950
他非常想留在古鲁的莲足下 所以他向神祷告 他该做什么
he wanted so much to be at the Guru’s Feet,
so he prayed to God, so what to do?

35
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,220
他请求他的母亲 说 妈妈 我不能留在这个地方
He asked his mum, said,
"Mum, I can’t be in this place."

36
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,330
他的母亲说 不 我的孩子 你是我的孩子 你必须在家
His mother said, "No, my child, you
are my child, you have to stay at home.

37
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,060
四岁的年龄 你要去哪 住在森林吗
Four years old, what you will
go and live in the forest?"

38
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,710
母亲哭了 说 你必须留下
So, the mother cried,
said, "You must stay!"

39
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,150
所以 在印度传统中 你必须留下 你需要听从父母
So, in the Hindu tradition, you have
to stay. You listen to your parents.

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,680
四岁的孩子 如果你不听话 会得到一个耳光
Four years old, if you
don’t listen, you get a slap.

41
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,730
所以 在那之后他开始祈祷 那天晚上他祈祷
So, after that he prayed.
That night he prayed,

42
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,020
看 我的内心是想为你而活 神 我不想要这个世界的其他东西
"Look, my inner feeling is that I want to live
for You, God! I don’t want anything in this world.

43
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,130
没有什么能使我真正快乐
Nothing can make
me really happy."

44
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,800
他的呼唤 他的祈祷 是如此的真诚
So, his call, his prayer
was so sincere,

45
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,550
他说 神 你来决定我该怎么做 我不能违抗母亲的要求
he said, "Lord, You decide for me
what to do. I can’t deny my mother’s

46
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,220
但我也无法忽略内在强烈的感受 因为这是真理
request and I can’t deny what I am feeling
strongly inside of me." Because this is the truth.

47
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,840
当今人们拒绝他们真实的感受 而听从他们愚蠢的头脑 但那罗陀不会
People deny the truth of their feeling and listen to
their stupid mind nowadays, but Narada could not.

48
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,770
俩方面都正确 母亲所说的和他的心告诉他的
Both is right, what the mother
is saying and what his heart is telling him.

49
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,040
所以 他向那罗延神祈祷并说
So, he prayed to Shriman
Narayana and said,

50
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,930
那罗延 你是唯一 你是万物之源
"Narayana, You are the only One!
You are the cause of everything.

51
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,240
你是一切的执行者 你来选择
You are the doer of
everything. You choose!"

52
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,060
那天晚上他的母亲 一条蛇咬了这位母亲的脚一口 然后她死了
That night his mother – a snake bit
the feet of the mother and she died.

53
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:42,400
这就选择好了 生命的给予者 祂有权利拿走生命
So, it was decided. The giver of life,
He had the right to take the life.

54
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,420
那罗陀把那视作一个指示 他必须只为了那罗延神而活
So, Narada took it as a sign that he
must live only for Shriman Narayana.

55
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,240
所以 当她 [非常简单] 去世
So, as she died...
[Very simple].

56
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,840
容易 简单 [那罗陀觉得现在会好一些] 当然
Easy, simple! [Narada felt that it
will be like okay now...] Of course!

57
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,970
因为 你瞧 现在因为痛苦
Because, you see,
look, now due to misery

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,220
你所谓的 你的母亲 你的父亲 那就是为什么你感到痛苦和悲哀
which you have called, your mother,
your father, that’s why you feel pain and sadness.

59
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,310
她是一个很好的女人 她非常的
But look, she was a good
woman, she was very

60
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,880
有灵性 她肯定上升到了非常高的高度 
spiritual, for sure she
ascended to very high level 

61
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,550
甚至是和神祂自己一样的高度
of even being 
with the Lord Himself.

62
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,000
那罗陀离开并开始再次寻找他的古鲁
So, Narada left and started
searching for his Guru again.

63
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,330
他四处寻找古鲁 当然 这位嘉伽德古鲁不会一直待在一个地方
So, he went everywhere searching for the Guru.
Of course, the Jagadguru doesn’t stay in one place.

64
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,350
他找啊 找啊 找啊 找啊
So, he was searching, searching,
searching, searching.

65
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,020
几个月过去 他找寻着 哭泣着 痛苦着
For months and months, he was
searching, crying, paining.

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,460
最终 他站在一颗树下前面
Finally, he just stood
in front of – under a tree

67
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,110
并仅仅念诵 那罗延 那罗延 那罗延 那罗延 
and he just chanted, "Narayana,
Narayana, Narayana, Narayana".

68
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,170
那样持续了数月
That was continuously for
months and months,

69
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,660
那找寻是如此的强烈 让那罗延神祂自己来到他身旁
and that search was so intense that even
Shriman Narayana Himself came to him.

70
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,970
四岁时 那罗延对他展现
Narayana appeared to him
when he was four years old.

71
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,530
当那罗延在他面前出现 祝福他
So, when Narayana appeared in front
of him, blessed him.

72
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,620
一旦他品尝到了那花蜜
So, once he had
tasted that nectar,

73
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,130
一旦他瞥见那罗延神
once he had the
glimpse of Shriman Narayana,

74
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,260
那罗延神祝福他然后消失 一旦你已瞥见那罗延神 就没有回路了
Narayana blessed him and disappeared. Once you
have the glimpse of Narayana, there is no way back.

75
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:22,480
他的一生 在他的第一世
So, throughout his lives,
in that first life of him,

76
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:30,400
他仅仅念诵 那罗延 那罗延 那罗延 并渴望着
he was only chanting "Narayana,
Narayana, Narayana" and longing,

77
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,060
带着再一次瞥见那罗延神的欲望在头脑中
with the desire in the mind to have
another time, another glimpse of Narayana.

78
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,550
所以 终其一生他再也没有瞥见过那罗延
So, throughout his life he never
got a single glimpse of Narayana.

79
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,530
仅仅一次 几秒钟 就是那样 
Only one time,
few seconds, that’s it.

80
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,060
随着时间的流逝 他的生命即将结束
So, as time was passing by,
his life was – he was dying.

81
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,060
当他即将死去时 带着这份渴望在头脑中
As he was dying, with his
mind he had this desire.

82
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,400
当然 那罗延在最后的时刻出现在他面前
Of course, Narayan appeared
in front of him at the last moment.

83
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,260
当那罗延在最后的时刻出现在他面前时
As Narayana appeared in front
of him at the last moment,

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
那罗延
"Narayana,"

85
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,310
他说 神 我一直渴望着你
he said, "Lord, I’ve
been longing for You,

86
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,040
我一直想着你 我一直只渴望着你
I’ve been thinking about You,
I’ve been desiring only You."

87
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,440
那罗延那说 听着 他说 为什么你不早点来
Narayana said, “Listen.” He said,
"Why You didn’t come earlier?

88
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,400
现在是我即将死去的时候 你为什么这时候来
Now it’s time for me to die,
why You came at that moment?"

89
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,370
至尊主说 看 我也是想来的 但有个问题
Bhagavan said, "Look, I also wanted
to come, but there was a problem:

90
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,910
在你的头脑中 你有着那想要见我的欲望
in your mind you had
that desire to see Me.

91
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,820
因为那再次瞥见我的欲望 我不能来
Due to that desire to have a glimpse
of Me again, I could not come."

92
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,000
由于那头脑中的欲望 因为头脑是物质的
Due to the desire in that mind,
because mind is material.

93
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,460
头脑是微妙的 但是它正跑向物质
Mind is subtle, but it’s
running towards material.

94
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,680
所以 你想要一个神的物质化的版本在这个世界上
So, you want to have a material
vision of the Lord into this world.

95
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,730
至尊主说 不 我想到来 注意到这点
So, Bhagavan said, "No, I wanted
to come." Note that well,

96
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,710
那罗延甚至说 我想到来 但我不能
that even Shriman Narayana said,
"I wanted to come, but I could not come

97
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,170
由于那欲望在你的头脑中 接着 至尊主再一次为那诅咒了他
due to that desire in your mind." Then here
Bhagavan again cursed him for that,

98
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:20,150
因为你的头脑中的欲望 你必须多出生84世 然后你可以达到我
"Due to that desire in your mind, you shall
be born 84 lives more, then you can attain Me."

99
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,170
这里 甚至祂的一个形象都不能  怎么讲 抹去那欲望
Here, even a vision of Him could
not – how say – erase that desire.

100
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,930
所以 他不得不再出生84世
So, he had to be
born again 84 lives.

101
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,370
他将出生84世 但至尊主祝福他 他将记得
So, 84 lives he was born, but Bhagavan
blessed him that he will remember

102
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,970
并且将拥有相同的渴望 没有欲望的渴望
and he will have the same
longing, longing without desire.

103
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,660
你瞧 欲望是在头脑中 渴望来自于心
You see? Desire is in the mind,
longing is from the heart.

104
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,240
所以 至尊主祝福他 在这些84世中你将记得一切
So, Bhagavan blessed him that, "In these
84 lives you will remember everything.

105
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,730
你将拥有对我的渴望 你将在每一刻 每一世都记得
You will have that longing for Me and you
will remember each time, each life."

106
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,800
在84世后 至尊主出现并给了他永恒的生命 使他永生
So, after 84 lives Bhagavan appeared and
gave him immortal life, immortalised him.

107
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,370
他获得了他的灵性身体 这体现出这并不容易
He attained his spiritual body.
That shows that it’s not easy.

108
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:18,680
每一世 就是他的书写 他从那罗陀巴克提经谈到
So, each life, that’s how he wrote,
he talked about the Narada Bhakti Sutra

109
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,460
吠陀经
to Vyasa.

110
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,860
那就是吠陀经所写的
So, that’s what Vyasa wrote.

111
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,640
如果你认为奉爱是那么简单的话
So, if you think
bhakti is that simple...

112
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,860
看看 对于那罗陀都甚至是困难的
So, even for Narada
it was difficult.
