1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,330
科技是重要的 这是社会的发展 
...technology is important.
This is the growth of society,

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,770
但你的生活并不受技术统治
but your life is not
governed by technology.

3
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,370
就个人来讲 生活本身是什么 那是人们已经忘记的东西
You personally, what is life itself,
that’s what people have forgotten.

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,820
他们什么都做 他们严重依赖机器为他们做的
You see, they do everything, they depend
so much on what machines do for them

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,710
他们的理解能力 没有机器时的行动能力
that their capacity of understanding,
their capacity of functioning without machine

6
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,800
在变得越来越弱 所以 他们自己的作为人的能力
is becoming less and less. So,
their own faculty of being human

7
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,150
在逐渐丧失
is diminishing.

8
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,310
一方面 你必须
You see, in one
way you have to go,

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,550
和科技一起成长 但是科技不是一切
you have to grow with technology,
but technology is not everything.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,820
当今 你们在讨论自动控制 移动手机 所有这些
You see, nowadays - you are talking about
robotic, you are talking about mobile, all this,

11
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,170
这些是在我们生活中非常基本的东西
these are things which are
very essential, in our life,

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,150
因为生活中必须使用到它们
because you have to go
through life with that also.

13
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,680
如果没有它 一些东西缺失了
If you don’t have it, there
is something missing.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,770
有趣的是 我遇到一个人
Funny, I met somebody in

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,060
在葡萄牙  他直到现在也不用
Portugal, who till
now he doesn’t use

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,730
网络或任何东西 令人惊奇的是 他是一个年轻人 他多大
internet or anything. Amazing,
he is a young guy. How old is he?

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,350
30岁 他不用 他说 不 我不想用它们
30 years old. He doesn’t. He said,
"No, I don’t want to use it."

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,330
不是他不会使用这些 我肯定他会 但他不想用
It’s not that he can’t use it. I’m sure he
can use it, but he doesn’t want to use it.

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,480
这里重点是 人们经常
And this is the thing,
you see, people always

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,530
依赖于科技做任何事情
depend upon technology
for everything.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,080
没有科技 会发生什么
Without that,
what would happen?

22
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,400
他们能完成工作吗 不 他们将不能胜任
Can they function? No, they
will not be able to function.

23
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,750
在灵性的道路上我们必须利用一切 但是那不是你
You see, on the spiritual path we have to
use everything, but that is not who you are.

24
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,600
你是更加深远的 你的机器人能为你冥想吗
You are something more.
Can your robot meditate for you?

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,260
它不能 如果别人 一个人 都不能为你冥想 一个人机器人能为你做什么
It can’t. If somebody else, a human being, can’t
meditate for you, what a robot would do for you?

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,600
你的手机能为你冥想吗 不 它不能
Can your mobile
do that? No, it can’t.

27
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:56,440
所以 那就是 当一个人需要用到科技 他必须利用它
So, there is – you see, when one needs
to use technology, one must use it,

28
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,530
但人们不能忘记 技术并不是一切
but one has not to forget that
technology is not everything.

29
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,480
想象你在说我们不能 我们不看人们的眼睛
Imagine you are saying that we can’t
– we don’t look at people in the eyes,

30
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,000
感谢神通过答善 我看进人们的眼睛
thanks God through Darshan
I look at everybody in the eyes,

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,110
但实际上我没有看你的眼睛 但那是很多人认为那就是我在看着的东西
but actually I don’t look at your eyes, but that’s
what many people think that’s what I am looking at.

32
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,420
经常的 当人们来答善的时候 看到他们瞪大眼睛
Very often you see people opening their
eyes big when they come for Darshan

33
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,800
想着 尊者吉正看进我的眼睛里 我在你们的眼睛里看什么呢
and thinking, "Swamiji is looking in my eyes."
What would I look at these eyes of yours?

34
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,460
里面没有什么看的
There is nothing
in it to look at.

35
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,620
要看的在你的灵魂里
What has to be looked
at it’s in your soul.

36
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,730
那就是我去看的
That’s what I look at.

37
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,680
你的眼睛没有什么 今天它在这里 明天不在那了 你眼瞎了 完了
Your eyes have nothing. It’s here today,
tomorrow is not there, you are blind, finish,

38
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,550
得白内障了
cataract.

39
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,170
所以 眼睛里是没什么可看的
So, there is nothing
to look in the eyes.

40
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,620
但当你能看到某人的灵魂
But when you can look
in the soul of somebody,

41
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,150
无论他们是否有东西 那才是最重要的
whether they have something or not,
that’s what is the most important thing.

42
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,48
你的眼睛所能看到的是有限的
What these eyes perceive
you to see is only limited.

43
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,370
它是有限的 受到摩耶呈现给你的幻觉的限制
It’s limited, limitation to the vision
of what Maya perceived you.

44
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,130
但你能看到超过那的东西吗
But beyond that
can you look?

45
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,600
你不能 科技能使你看到那吗 不 你不能
You can’t. Can technology make
you look at that? No, you can’t.

46
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,910
事物的深度 不 科技将会进步
The deepness of things, no.
Technology will advance,

47
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,260
但人们不应该忘记他们是谁
but people should not
forget who they are.

48
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,310
你瞧 当我们看着吠陀经 圣典 他们谈论着关于科技
You see, when we look at the Veda,
the scriptures, they talk about technology,

49
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,370
甚至是最先进的科技 
even far most advanced
technology that

50
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,510
或者现今还没有被发明的科技
nowadays has
not yet been discovered,

51
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,600
但是瑜伽行者依赖那吗 不 他们不
but does the yogis depend
on that? No, they do not.

52
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,950
他们能坐在一个地方就观察到一切
They could sit in one place
and observe everything.

53
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,130
他们能坐在一个地方并同时出现在很多地方
They can sit in one place and be
in many places at the same time.

54
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,820
所以  什么是更强大的  科技还是你
So, what is more powerful:
technology or who you are?

55
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,420
科技不会带你了悟神
Technology will not lead
you to God-Realisation.

56
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,400
科技不会有那种感觉 有时当你拿起 它叫什么
Technology doesn’t have that feeling. Sometimes
when you take the – what you call it? –

57
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,570
手机 说 Siri(Iphone的智能语音助手) 什么是爱
the phone, you say,
"Siri, what is love?"

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,950
Siri不会跟你讲什么是爱 它只能给你一个什么是爱的定义
Siri can’t tell you what is love. It can
give you a definition only of what is love.

59
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,660
如果你告诉Siri 我爱你
If you tell Siri,
"I love you",

60
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,970
它将回答你 是的 我非常 非常快乐 但我不理解
it will answer you, "Yes, I am very – how say
– very happy about it, but I don’t understand."

61
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,680
所以 那就是科技
So, that’s technology.

62
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,420
你有你的感受 科技不会理解你的感受
And you have your feeling. Technology
will not understand your feeling.

63
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:56,840
你需要科技 但你不应该依赖于科技
You see, you need technology, but you
should not be dependent upon technology,

64
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,040
因为你看 这
because you see, this

65
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,820
完全的感受或是圆满的感觉
feeling of completeness
or the feeling of

66
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,710
科技不会带你到那里
fullness, technology
can’t lead you there.

67
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,420
只有通过你的成就法 只有通过你的灵性练习 
It is only through your sadhana,
only through your spiritual practices,

68
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,080
接着你将会有这内在的满足
then you will have
this inner satisfaction.

69
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,310
如果你试图寻找内在的满足
If you are trying to look
for inner satisfaction

70
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,330
从外在的世界里 是不可能的
into the outside
world, not possible.

71
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,510
你可能拥有生活中的一切 你可以有最好的苹果手机或者
You may have everything in life,
you can have the best iPhone or

72
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,170
你想要的手机 最高级的一个
mobiles you want, the
most sophisticated one,

73
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:53,350
你可能身家百万 从百万到数万亿 等等
you may have million, from
million to trillion, and so on,

74
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,840
你可以买最好的 最美丽的房子 你可以有最好的车
you can buy the best, the most beautiful
house, you can have the best car,

75
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,000
但如果你没有这种内在的满足 如果你内在没有这种内在的幸福
but if you don’t have this inner satisfaction, if you
don’t have this inner happiness inside of you,

76
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,200
你能说你很快乐吗 不 你不能
can you say you are
happy? No, you will not.

77
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,200
你可以在你的脸上露出一个灿烂的笑容 你可以表现出快乐 满足
You can put a big smile upon your face,
you can appear to be joyful, to be content,

78
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,310
人们可以看到 哦 看看这个人 他拥有一切 或者 她拥有一切 她一定快乐
people can see, "Oooh, look this one, he has everything",
or, "She has everything, she must be happy!",

79
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,060
但内在他们很空虚
but inside they are empty.

80
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,920
因为那就是我们必须理解的 那满足
Because that’s what we have
to understand, that fullness

81
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,000
不是外在的东西能使你快乐的
is not the external things
that can make you happy,

82
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,400
因为你的真正的幸福是更深的东西
because your true
happiness is something deeper.

83
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,440
真正的幸福是心灵上的东西
The true happiness is
something spiritual,

84
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,840
是不受外在界限
is something which
is not bound by

85
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,260
所限制的东西
the limitation of the outside.

86
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:08,200
你不会说 如果我有了这个 我将快乐 如果我没有那个 我将不高兴 不 它不是关于那个
You can’t say, "If I have this, I will be happy. If I don’t
have that, I will not be happy." No, it’s not about that.

87
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,550
它是更加深远的
It is something more

88
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
科技不能给你的东西
which technology
can’t give you,

89
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,570
但悲伤的是当今无论你去哪
but it’s sad that nowadays
wherever you go –

90
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,400
我在立陶宛讲过这个
you see, I was telling
this in Lithuania.

91
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,800
在过去 当人们去教堂或者寺庙时 他们会把手机放下来 不是吗
In ancient time, people when they go to the church
or the temples, they would put off their mobile, no?

92
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,750
他们会说 好 这是我坐下来并祈祷的时间
They would say, "Okay, this is the
time where I will sit and pray,

93
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,330
我向神奉献我生命的地方 并且那段时间手机不会响
where I will dedicate my life to God." And
during that time the mobile would not ring,

94
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:52,480
头脑不会转移注意力到左 右 他们的注意力将会集中
the mind would not be diverted left, right.
Their concentration would be there.

95
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,000
但当今无论你去哪个寺庙
But nowadays whenever
you go in the temple,

96
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,350
手机是他们的伙伴
mobile is their partner,

97
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,680
手机是他们的丈夫 他们的妻子 男朋友 女朋友
their husband, their wife, boyfriend,
girlfriend is just the mobile.

98
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
没有手机他们无法生活
Without that they can’t live.

99
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:22,280
祈祷在继续 你在做你的祈祷 你在服务神 取代
Prayers are going on, you are doing your prayer,
you are serving the Lord, in place of concentrating

100
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,200
专注于你的服务，在应该专注于
on your service, in place
of concentrating on:

101
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:30,710
让头脑在神的莲足下时
Yes, let that mind be at
the Feet of the Lord,

102
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,640
你在做什么 你在发短信
what are you doing?
You are texting.

103
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,640
你坐在最后面
You  sit at the
back completely,

104
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,750
没有人能看见你 藏着就好像你在冥想中做深深的祈祷
where nobody can see you, hiding as if you
are praying deeply in meditation like that.

105
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:58,820
你像这样坐着 他们在不断地发短信，那就是祈祷已经变成的样子
You sit like this. They are texting continuously,
and that is how prayer has become.

106
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,910
人们想要快乐 在这可以看到 不 你不需要走的很远
And the people want to be happy. And here
you see. No, you don’t need to go far away.

107
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:12,570
去寺庙 看看最后一排 你将会看到
Go to the temple itself, look
at the back row, you will see.

108
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,800
如果那会带你到真正的幸福 那好的 去这样做吧
So, if that will lead you to
true happiness, then yes, do it.

109
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,950
但那不会带你到真正的幸福 它将带给你更多的痛苦
But that will not lead you to true
happiness. It will lead you to more misery,

110
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,220
更多的不幸福 当你看到你的邻居在改变
more unhappiness. When you see
that your neighbour is moving,

111
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,530
成长并获得某些东西
growing and achieving
something,

112
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:42,530
接着你问自己为什么你不能 为什么你不行
then you ask yourself why
you can’t, why you don’t.

113
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,040
它是因为你的头脑专注在了别的地方
It’s because your mind
is focused somewhere else.

114
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,820
你的邻居的头脑在专注于神 当然他将获得神性
Your neighbour’s mind is focused on the
Divine, of course he will have the Divine.

115
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,950
所以 想象下一次答善 我会带个手机并坐在这里
So, imagine next Darshan
I’ll take a mobile and sit here

116
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,440
你们都过来 把头放在手机上 你将会被赐福
and you all come, put your head on
the mobile, you’ll have the Darshan.

117
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,480
你为什么必须在脚下跪拜 我在手机上
Why you have to bow down
at the feet? I put the picture

118
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,130
放一张脚的照片 俩边 仅仅低下你的头然后离开
of the feet there on the mobile,
two times, just put your head and go

119
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:23,260
我会让日本人来发明俩只手
and I will maybe ask the
Japanese to invent the hand.

120
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,000
那是一个好方法 对我来说很好
That would be a good
way. It’s fine for me.

121
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,220
我能坐在我的屋里 看着你们所有人进行这样的流程
I can sit in my bungalow there
and look at you all go through that.

122
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,510
你还会得到自动机械化的启引
You will have also
robotic enlightenment.

123
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:51,170
那真是一个我们能做的好生意 我们能卖自动机械化启引
That’s a good business we can make.
We can sell robotic enlightenment.

124
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,510
也许某人有 因为当今任何东西都能买
Maybe somebody has – because
everything can be bought nowadays.

125
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,730
如果你想要启引
If you want enlightenment,

126
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,280
你可以去到这大师那 他卖你5000美元 来吧 我将给你启引
you go to this Master, he will sell you for 5000
dollars, "Come, I’ll give you enlightenment.

127
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,620
你想要这个 来吧 我将教你如何得到它 你懂的 一切都能买
You want this? Come, I’ll teach you how
to get it." ..?.. You know, everything.

128
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,200
也许一些芯片可以被放进你的头里
So, maybe some chips can
be put inside of your head.

129
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,020
首先 我们先在Pepe身上试试
First, we’ll try it on Pepe.

130
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,150
但好在他已经被启引了 但他还不知道
But the good thing is that he is
enlightened, but he doesn’t know about it.

131
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,280
那是件好事
And that’s a good
thing about it.

132
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:41,970
所以 你看 技术 没有科技你不能
So, you see, technology, without
technology you would not be able to

133
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,150
看到 你不能听到 科技是好的
see, you would not be able
to listen. Technology is good,

134
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,170
但你应该知道你在这个大计划中想要什么
but you should know what
you want in that big scheme,

135
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:01,150
因为如果你不知道你想要的 接着你仍然会 你将会依赖上科技
because if you don’t know what you want,
then you will still, you will depend on technology.

136
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,020
你会期待科技给你真正的幸福
Then you will expect that technology
will give you that true happiness,

137
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,420
那是不可能的
which is not possible.

138
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,800
同样的 要利用摩耶的世界 要利用科技
It is the same, the world of Maya is
to be used, technology is to be used,

139
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,750
但你不应该依赖于那些
but you should not be
depending upon that.
