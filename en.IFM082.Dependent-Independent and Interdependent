1
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:10,711
So, through thousands of years,
thousands of lives, you know,
经过数千年 几千世

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,022
you have rotated into that Maya
thinking, "Yes, I will be happy."
你已经轮回进入到摩耶 想着 是的 我将会快乐

3
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:23,888
But yet, you have not yet found that,
because true happiness is not in this.
但是然而 你还没有找到那 因为真正的快乐不在这里

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:28,466
True happiness is
through Grace only.
真正的快乐只能通过恩典获得
5
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:33,777
Because you can't attain the Lord. Very
often you see people think, you know,
因为你不能臻达神 通常你看到人们认为

6
00:00:34,066 --> 00:00:39,666
God is like a market place that you
can just go there and say, "Oh God,
神就像是一个市场和你可以仅去到那说 哦 神

7
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:43,711
I want to come to You,
I want to come to heaven,
我想到你身边 我想去天堂

8
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:47,600
I will do good things here."
You are bargaining with God.
我将在这里做好事 你和神讨价还价

9
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:50,488
No, it's not about that.
不 它不是那样的
 
10
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:55,355
What He will value is how much
love do you have inside of you
祂将重视的是你的内在有多少爱

11
00:00:56,133 --> 00:01:00,155
and what kind of love do you
have inside of you, you know.

12
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,133
Love is not something that
爱不是

13
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:08,088
what you say today, "Yes, I love you, I love you",
tomorrow you say, "Who is that person?"
你今天说 是的 我爱你 我爱你 明天你说 那人是谁

14
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:14,066
Love is not that it's playing yoyo with you,
today is here, tomorrow is not there.
爱不是和你玩游戏 今天在这里 明天不在那里

15
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,288
That's not love.
That's emotion.
那不是爱 那是情感

16
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:28,488
That's what people say, you know, two people,
 you know, there are three kinds of love:
那是人们说的 俩人之间 有三种爱

17
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:32,688
dependent, independent,
interdependent.
依赖的 独立的 互相依赖的

18
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:40,422
So, dependent love, that's what
you see every day in daily life.
所以 依赖的爱 那就是你每天在日常生活中能看到的

19
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:47,866
People love each other. Husband depends
on wife, wife depends on husband,
人们爱着彼此 丈夫依赖于妻子 妻子依赖于丈夫

20
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:52,400
children depend on parents, parents depend on
children and so on, you know, and everybody says,
孩子依赖于父母 父母依赖于孩子等等 每个人说

21
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:55,644
"I love you, I love you"
without any feeling of love.
我爱你 我爱你 没有任何爱的感觉

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,511
The same love today is, "Oh, you are
my sunshine. Oh, you are my..."
同样的爱今天是 哦 你是我的阳光 哦 你是我的

23
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:08,511
whatever, whatever you tell to your
people. Then after that you say, "Oh,
无论什么 无论什么你告诉他人 接着之后你说 哦

24
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:11,444
you devil person! Because
of you, you ruined my life!"
你这个魔鬼 因为你 你毁了我的生活

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,466
No! You can see that throughout the day itself,
you know, dozens of times you change.
你可以从一整天中看到那 你一天变几十次

26
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:26,711
And that's what you call love. No, that's
dependency. You depend on the people,
那就是你称之为的爱 不 那是依赖 你依赖于其他人

27
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,200
you know. That's why it is said, no?
- love can open the gate of heaven
那就是为什么说 不是吗 爱可以打开天堂之门

28
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,288
and it also opens
the gate of hell.
同时它也可以打开地狱之门

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:48,755
So... Then you have independent.
Independent people say,
所以 然后你有独立的爱 独立的人说

30
00:02:50,466 --> 00:02:54,933
"I love you. You can do
whatever you want. Be free.
我爱你 你可以做任何你想做的 自由的去做

31
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:57,711
You have freedom."
你拥有自由

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,533
They don't really love.
This is all hypocrite love.
他们不是真正的爱 这都是虚伪的爱

33
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:09,422
They think mostly of their freedom than love,
because in love you don't think of yourself.
他们考虑的更多的是自由而不是爱 因为在爱中你是不会想到你自己的

34
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:16,977
So, you call it independent love.
"Yes, you can do whatever you want."
所以 你称作独立的爱 是的 你可以做任何你想做的

35
00:03:17,844 --> 00:03:23,355
But in reality, they think only on themselves.
And these people can't really love.
但实际上 他们只考虑他们自己 并且这些人不会真的爱

36
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,244
Because they are so much attached
to their own freedom, they can't love.
因为他们如此的依附他们自己的自由 他们不能爱

37
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:37,133
Then you have a third kind of
love which is interdependence.
接着你有第三种互相依赖的爱

38
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:40,244
In interdependent love
在互相依赖的爱中

39
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:49,400
this is where two people come together, then
they feel that love, they feel that connection,
这是俩个人来到一起 然后他们感受到那种爱 他们感受到那种连接

40
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:54,511
they know each other. There is
this heart to heart connection.
他们熟悉彼此 有心与心的连接

41
00:03:56,288 --> 00:04:01,866
There is not dependence
on each other, there is not
那没有彼此的依赖 那没有双方的

42
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:07,511
independency on
each other, no,
独立 没有

43
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,666
but there is this comprehension,
there is this synchronisation,
但是那里有理解 有同步

44
00:04:14,466 --> 00:04:18,355
there is this link, you know,
and that's true love.
有连接 那是真正的爱

45
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:27,977
This is where one forgets about
oneself, but think of their beloved.
这是一个人忘记他自己 而想着他们的爱人

46
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,444
But that kind of love is
quite rare, you know.
但是那种爱是非常罕见的
