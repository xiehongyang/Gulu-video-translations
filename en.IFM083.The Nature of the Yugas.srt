1
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:10,577
Look, Kali Yuga is not
yet to be finished, you know.
你知道，铁器年代还没有过去

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:14,844
There are still some
millions of years for it to finish,
仍然还有几百万年它才能结束

3
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:20,711
so I don‘t think it's
a question that's how say ?
所以我不认为这个问题

4
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:25,711
concerns anyone, because
you will not see Satya Yuga.
需要任何人忧虑 因为你看不到黄金年代

5
00:00:27,644 --> 00:00:30,755
But we have to understand
what is Satya Yuga,
但是我们必须理解什么是黄金年代

6
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:36,800
we have to understand what is Kali Yuga
and what is Dwapara, what is Treta.
我们必须理解什么是铁器年代，什么是青铜年代，什么是白银年代

7
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,177
These yugas are not
这些年代不是

8
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:45,000
rotating � you know,
now you can say,
循环的 知道吗 现在你可以说

9
00:00:45,355 --> 00:00:49,244
"Ah yes, we are in Kali Yuga, that's
why all these things are happening",
噢 是的 我们处于铁器年代 那就是为什么这些事情会发生

10
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:52,755
you know.
This is not true.
这是不对的

11
00:00:55,088 --> 00:01:00,200
Those minds which are centred
in God, they are in Satya Yuga,
那些头脑专注于神的人 他们就处于黄金年代

12
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,911
because God is alive for them.
They see God, they perceive the Divine.
因为神对他们来说是存在的 他们看见神 他们感知到神

13
00:01:05,177 --> 00:01:08,466
If you ask that for
a saint, the saint
如果你去问一位圣人 圣人

14
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:12,844
will say, "Yes, I meet Him every
day. I talk with Him every day."
会说 是的 我每天都遇见祂 我每天都和祂说话

15
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,177
And this is the effect
of Satya Yuga
这就是黄金年代的影响

16
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:24,844
where you can perceive the Divine
at all time, you feel His Love at all time,
你总是能感知到神 你总是能感觉到祂的爱

17
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:34,333
no? Then you have the effect of Gor
Kali Yuga, deep Kali Yuga which is
不是吗 然后还有铁器年代的影响 深层次的铁器年代是

18
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:39,600
the crazy mind, you know, the suicide
bombers and so on, so on.
疯狂的头脑 自杀炸弹等等

19
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:46,288
And then you have Treta
and Dwapara at the same time.
然后同时白银时代有和青铜年代

20
00:01:49,555 --> 00:01:54,533
You see? And then let's take, for example,
in Dwapara Yuga, the time of Krishna,
让我们 举个例子 在青铜年代 奎师那的年代

21
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:59,866
when they were pulling
Draupadi by her hair,
当他们拉着黑公主(德罗波蒂)的头发

22
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:05,688
dragging her to the court, you know,
what kind of act was that?
拽着她到宫殿里时 那种行为是什么

23
00:02:07,444 --> 00:02:09,444
Was it not an act
of Kali Yuga?
不是铁器年代的行为吗

24
00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:12,955
So, Kali Yuga
was also there.
所以 铁器年代也在那

25
00:02:14,644 --> 00:02:18,911
So, you see, all the yugas
rotate at the same time
所以 所有的年代同时在循环

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,022
and now, right now, the yuga
that is going on, it is dual,
并且现在 当下 所有的年代都在发生 这是同时的

27
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:28,977
there are different
yugas together.
不同的年代在一起

28
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:33,355
For the devotees, like I said,
those which are surrendered to God
对于奉献者 像我说的 那些臣服于神的人

29
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:37,177
it is Satya Yuga. Because they meet Him
every day, they see Him, they feel Him,
在黄金年代 因为他们每天遇见祂 他们看到祂 他们感受到祂

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,111
they realise Him. For those
which are searching still,
他们了解祂 对于那些仍在寻找

31
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:46,644
they will find it in Dwapara
Yuga or Treta Yuga,
他们仍在青铜年代或者白银年代寻找

32
00:02:47,755 --> 00:02:53,155
but they will find it here itself.
It's all in your level of consciousness.
但是他们自己将在这找到祂 一切都在你的意识等级中

33
00:02:57,622 --> 00:03:00,822
So, you see, the
yugas are all together.
所以 你看 所有年代都在一起

34
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:10,688
And then the most important thing that
you understand in the scriptural-wise,
然后最重要的是就是你去在圣典智慧中理解


35
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:17,577
in the external reality it is Kali Yuga,
but the internal reality it is Dwapara.
外在的实相中它是铁器年代 但内在的实相它是青铜年代

36
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:26,755
That's why Babaji has said that in this
time, in this age, bhakti is very important.
那就是为什么巴巴吉说过在这个时期 在这个时代 巴克提是非常重要的

37
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:31,755
That's why Krishna has
emphasised before, you know,
那就是为什么奎师那在以前已经强调过的

38
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:36,977
in the last chapter He
said only bhakti, you know,
在最后一章祂只说了巴克提

39
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:42,511
there is nothing else. Without bhakti -
Bhakti Yoga is the most important one.
除此之外别无其他 除了巴克提 - 巴克提瑜伽是最重要的

40
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:47,822
But Bhakti Yoga is not
that simple. Like I said,
但是巴克提瑜伽不是那么简单 就像我说的

41
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:52,844
you can say, yes, you surrender the mind,
does it mean that it is surrendering?
你可以说 是的 你放弃了头脑 这是否意味着它是在放弃

42
00:03:56,688 --> 00:04:01,711
So, bhakti, true bhakti, is when that
mind is surrendered into the Lord.
所以 巴克提 真正的巴克提 是当那头脑臣服于神

43
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:08,200
It's not the yoga asana, all
these things. These are all Maya.
它不是瑜伽体式 所有的这些东西 这些都是摩耶

44
00:04:10,488 --> 00:04:14,311
There are only two realms: the
Divine realm and the realm of Maya.
只有俩个王国：神的王国和摩耶的王国
