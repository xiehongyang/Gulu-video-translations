you used the word statue.
讲过雕像 你们用单词statue(雕像)

00:00:18,133 --> 00:00:23,822
when it’s referred

00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:29,511
in the Hindu tradition we

It’s just a piece of
plastic, nothing else.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,977
So, it will come to a question,
say, yes, also the stone

Pratishta: Prana means the life force,

But what is happening
during Prana Pratishta,

00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,466
the Lord is more alive
within the heart of men.

所以 一个石头不能达到奎师那
一个石头不能达到那罗延

23
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,444

But humans are fools
sometimes due to Maya.

do Prana Pratishta.

between the deity and God.

39
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,955
So, during the prayer, there are
many mantras which are chanted.
所以 在祈祷的过程中 有很多颂歌被唱诵

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,755

00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:17,333
Because you are looking for Him
elsewhere when He is seated within you.
因为你正在其他地方找祂时祂就坐在你里面

85
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:27,511
And how to attain Him? Is only when your
mind runs towards Him, not your heart.

Very often people say,

but you have control over your mind.
你不能控制你的心 但是你可以控制你的头脑

88
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,177
That’s why Krishna said in the Gita,
"Surrender your mind to Me
那就是为什么奎师那在薄伽梵歌中说 放下你的头脑臣服于我

89
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:48,711
and I shall take care of everything."
He didn’t say, "Surrender your body",
我将照顾一切 祂没有说 放下你的身体

90
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,644
He didn’t say,
"Surrender your senses",
祂没有说 放下你的感官

91
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:57,755
He didn’t say surrender anything else,
He didn’t say surrender your soul.
祂没有说放下其他一切 祂没有说放下你的灵魂

92
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,755
How can you hold your soul and surrender
it? You can’t. You belong to Him already.
你怎么能留着你的灵魂并丢掉它 你不能 你已经属于祂

93
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,977
What He said? "Surrender
your mind upon to Me."
祂说了什么 向我臣服你的头脑

94
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:13,511
That’s why, when there is a deity
outside, it’s easy to surrender the mind.
那就是为什么 当那里有个外在的神像 就比较容易放下头脑

95
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,288
When you have an image outside,
it’s easy to surrender the mind.
当你有个外在的形象 就比较容易放下头脑

96
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:22,822
Because you are material, no? That body,
you have a mind, you have a body,
因为你是物质的 不是吗 那身体 你有一个头脑 你有一个身体

97
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:26,088
you have emotions, you have
intellect, you have senses:
你有情感 你有智力 你有感官

98
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:30,711
they are all material,
他们都是物质的

99
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:35,822
and the mind runs
towards the material.
并且头脑朝着物质奔跑

100
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:41,022
This is the nature of
the mind. The mind
这是头脑的天性 头脑

101
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,866
runs where there
is personal benefit.
朝着个人利益的地方跑

102
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,111
Where you get your personal
benefit, you will run there.
哪里能得到你的个人好处你就跑到哪里

103
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,666
This is the
greediness of men.
这是人类的贪婪

104
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,555
So,
所以 

105
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:02,466
the deity is a reminder
of the presence of God,
神像就是神的出现的提醒

106
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:06,688
where the mind
has to be focused.
是头脑必须专注的地方

107
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:11,600
So, Prana Pratishta
所以 注入生命力

108
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:19,177
is the ritual into
reminding oneself
是提醒一个人它自己的仪式

109
00:09:20,044 --> 00:09:22,688
that this is the
presence of God.
这就是神的显现

00:09:24,177 --> 00:09:27,155
There are many things what
happen during the Prana Pratishta,
很多事情发生在注入生命力仪式的过程中

111
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:32,355
even if it is just a mantra
or if it is just a symbol,
即使它只是一个颂歌或者它只是一个符号

112
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:38,244
but the Lord really
gives His presence.
但是神真的显现了

113
00:09:41,466 --> 00:09:45,822
There was a saint
in Rajasthan, actually,

So, one day there was
a big Prana Pratishta.

117
00:10:01,422 --> 00:10:04,866
So, the priest was chanting

在完成唱诵颂歌后 当然 我出门做所有的祷告 所有的这些事情

119
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:17,466
then we do arati, so everybody was
bowing down in front of the deity,
接着我们做arati 所以每个人都在神像前鞠躬

120
00:10:17,688 --> 00:10:22,177
but the saint refused to bow down.
They said, "Why?" He said,
但是圣人拒绝鞠躬 他们说 为什么 他说

121
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:28,577
"Krishna is not yet inside
of him, inside of the deity."
奎师那还没有在他里面 没有在神像里

122
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,377
They said, "How do you know?" He said,
"I’ll show you." So, he took a piece of cotton,
他们说 你怎么知道的 他说 我将展示给你 所以 他拿了一块棉花

123
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:39,977
placed it in front
of the nostril of the

124
00:10:42,177 --> 00:10:44,088
deity,
的鼻孔中

125
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,022
nothing. You see, if you put
a cotton in front of your nose,
什么都没发生 如果你把一块棉花放在你的鼻子面前

126
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,333
you know, this is how they test also if
somebody is still alive or is gone, you know.
你知道 这就是他们如何测试某个人是活着还是死了

127
00:10:56,977 --> 00:11:00,088
So, the cotton
is so fine that
所以 棉花没有动 哪怕

128
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:04,822
if any little bit of
breath, it will move.

129
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:12,177
So, nothing. So, then the saint said,

00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:17,711
and I am asking Him to
please, bless the deity,
