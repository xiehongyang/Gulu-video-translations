1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,460
世界上有俩处领域 
...you see, you have two
realms in this world, you know,

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,150
玛雅的领域和神的领域
the realm of Maya
and the realm of the Divine.

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:23,460
所以 受限制的万物就是玛雅的世界
So, everything which is bound
by limitation is the world of Maya

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,950
包括头脑 智力 你的情感
which includes the mind,
the intellect, your emotions,

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,800
和你的身体 你的感官等等
you know, and your body,
your senses and so on.

6
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:39,800 
它们都受到玛雅的限制 你有你的灵魂 它属于神
They are all bound by Maya. And then
you have your Atma which is Divine.

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,310
所以 你内在有这俩种
So, you have these
two inside of you.

8
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:49,460
有时你的灵魂正在提醒你生命中最重要的事情
Sometimes your Atma is reminding yourself,
you know, what is the most important thing in life

9
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,280
并且你有那强烈的感觉 但是你听从那吗 不 你不听从
and you have that deep feeling, but
do you listen to that? No, you don’t!

10
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,660
因为玛雅的世界已经极好地伪装了她自己
Because the world of Maya has
disguised Herself so wonderfully,

11
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,400
你知道的 如此诱人
you know,
so attractive,

12
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:12,310
如此令人着迷 如此快乐的以至于你认为 是的 我会很快乐
so mesmerising, so joyful that you
think that, "Yes, I will be happy."

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,620
并且很容易听从那个世界
And it’s easy to
listen to that world,

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,570
很容易朝向那 因为头脑和
it’s easy to divert towards
that, because that mind is

15
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:29,080
玛雅的相同的 它们以同一频率震动
the same as Maya, you know,
they vibrate in the same frequency.

16
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,510
所以 它是非常吸人引的
So, it’s very attractive.

17
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,460
所以 你更加的让自己 让那头脑被世界所吸引
So, more you let yourself – let that
mind be attracted to the world,

18
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,460
你陷入的更深
more you entangle into it.

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,840
那不意味着你的灵魂不会提醒你 它会的
It doesn’t mean that your
soul will not remind you. It will.

20
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,310
但有多少人真的跟随那
But how many people
really follow that?

21
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,970
很少 所以 这是俩个相对的世界
Very few. So, this is
two worlds of opposite,

22
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,200
你瞧 这些相对的俩个世界
you see, and these
two worlds of opposite:

23
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,620
薄伽梵奎师那提到过业瑜伽
Bhagavan Krishna talked
about the Karma Yoga,

24
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,820
智瑜伽和王瑜伽 不是吗
Jyaana Yoga and
Raja Yoga, no?

25
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,350
所以 存在着三种人 存在着三种内在的品质
So, these are three kinds of people that
exist, three qualities which exist inside.

26
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,260
但是祂也说过神性
But He talked
also the divine

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,550
不受任何东西限制
qualities which are
not bound by anything.

28
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,930
所以 你的灵魂 它是什么
So, your Atma,
what it is?

29
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,600
玛雅的产物还是神的产物
Product of Maya
or product of God?

30
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,510
[神]
[God.]

31
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,970
所以 你的灵魂引领你到哪里 内在还是外在
So, where is your Atma leading
you? In the world or outside?

32
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,800
[外在 但同时也是内在]
[Outside, but at the
same time in the world.]

33
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,550
不 是你的头脑引领你到外在
No, it is your mind that
is leading you outside.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,620
灵魂总是只有一个目标
Atma always
has only one aim.

35
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:59,130
灵魂不会有俩个目标 灵魂不会绑定于任何东西上
The Atma doesn’t have two aims. The
Atma is not attached to anything here.

36
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,310
是头脑绑定着一切
It is the mind that is
attached to everything.
