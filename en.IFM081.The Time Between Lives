1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,644
转世需要多长时间呢
How long does it 
take to reincarnate? 

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,022
通常对于灵性的人 为什么
For spiritual people 
very often, you see, why 

3
00:00:13,644 --> 00:00:15,133
你在灵性的道路上
you are on the spiritual path? 

4
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:22,511
因为你在灵性的道路上是为了去抵达某种至高的  抵达神
Because you are on the spiritual path 
to attain something Supreme, to attain God. 

5
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:29,022
所以 通常当一个奉献者去世了
So, very often when 
a devotee dies, 

6
00:00:29,844 --> 00:00:34,555
像奎师那在薄伽梵歌中说过的 那些臣服于我的人 我会照顾他们
like Krishna said also in the Gita, "Those 
who surrender to Me, I take control of them, 

7
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:38,288
我照顾他们 并且在生命的尽头他们将直接抵达我
I take care of them and at the end 
of their life they come directly to Me." 

8
00:00:39,488 --> 00:00:43,088
但我们不能将之视为理所当然  说  是的 我信奉奎师那 我爱祂
But we can’t take this for granted, say, 
"Yes, I believe in Krishna. I love Him, 

9
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:49,444
你知道 就是这样 当我去世了我将去到祂那 不 你不会
you know, and that’s it, when I die 
I will go to Him." No, you will not. 

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,777
通常人们认为那 是的 因为他们已经在灵性的道路上了
Very often people think that, yes, because 
they have been on the spiritual path, 

11
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:00,800
他们将会自由
you know, that 
they will be free. 

12
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:03,977
不 他们不会
No, they will not. 

13
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:11,822
像我说的 自由仅在你达到某种灵性的程度时到来
Like I said, freedom comes only when you 
have attained a certain degree of spirituality. 

14
00:01:13,244 --> 00:01:16,511
那是真的自由 当你自由时 意味着
That’s real freedom. And when 
you have freedom, which means 

15
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:21,488
最高的极乐将唤醒它自己  这可以在一世就发生
the supreme bliss will awake 
itself. It can happen in one life 

16
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:25,133
它也能在很多世后之发生
or it can happen 
in many lives. 

17
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:32,222
所以 对于一个只想抵达上主的奉献者 
So, for a bhakta it can 
happen if they have 

18
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:38,244
这可以发生 他们将很快出生
short-term only to attain the Lord, 
they will be born very quickly 

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,355
并且他们将很快再次出生 作为一个奉献者
and they will be born again as 
a bhakta, you know, as a devotee. 

20
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:51,688
所以 它可以通过大师的恩典 通过古鲁的恩典 通过神的恩典
So, it can be through the Grace of the Master, 
through the Grace of the Guru and the Grace of God, 

21
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:57,088
它可以在一年的时间内 它可以在俩年的时间内
it can be in a year, it can 
be in two years time. 

22
00:02:00,022 --> 00:02:04,800
但对于一个物质主义的人 最少需要一百年
But for a materialistic person 
a minimum is hundred years, 

23
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:08,600
有一个几百年的间隔
there is a gap 
of hundred years. 

24
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,933
所以 不要认为在这一世
So, don’t think that 
in this life if you 

25
00:02:14,688 --> 00:02:18,711
如果你认识某个人 如果那个人 业力不是那样的
know somebody, if that 
person karma it is not that. 

26
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:23,111
可能你将会再次出生 并在另外某一世你将遇到
Maybe you will be born again and 
in some other life you will meet. 

27
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:28,822
有时你在遇到某人之后还需要经历千百世
Sometimes you go through life thousand 
times after you meet somebody, 

28
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:34,044
因为你的业力的等级和他们业力的等级是完全不同的
because your level of karma and their 
level of karma is completely different. 

29
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:42,400
一些人出现 是的 我们将再次相遇
Some people appear, you know, 
say, "Yes, we will see us again." 

30
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:48,088
是的 某一天你肯定会再次相遇 你甚至都不知道什么时候你将会再次相遇
Yes, it’s sure you will see us one day, you 
know, you don’t even know when you will see. 

31
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:51,533
但那不是你 那不是你的
But it’s not you, you 
know, it’s not your – 

32
00:02:51,822 --> 00:02:55,288
当你谈及你 你认为你的灵魂的思考方式
you see, when you talk about you, 
you think that your soul is the same as 

33
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:57,666
和你的思考方式是一样的
thinking the way 
you are thinking, 

34
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:01,622
和你行为的方式是一样的 不 没有任何关系
you know, acting the way you are 
acting. No, it’s nothing to do with that. 

35
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:07,733
而且时间差 比如在这个物质世界你有一块手表
And the time laps, like here in the 
material world time you have a watch, 

36
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,888
你在看着你的时间 时间以一种方式运行
you know, you are looking at 
your time, time is in one way, 

37
00:03:11,355 --> 00:03:13,800
但是在另一边 时间不像那样存在着
but in the other side 
time doesn’t exist like that. 

38
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:20,844
那里的几秒钟 可能是这里的几百或者几千年
A few seconds of that time, it is 
hundreds or thousands of years here. 

39
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:26,844
你可以在《往世书》中看到 一个故事关于
And that you can see in the 
Puranas, you know, the story of – 

40
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:32,355
有一位国王和他的女儿去到梵天界
there was a king and his daughter 
who went to Brahma Loka. 

41
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:36,933
他们离开了他们的王国 他们去见梵天神
They left their kingdom, you know, 
they went to see Lord Brahma. 

42
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:40,955
所以 当他们回来时
So, when they came back, 

43
00:03:43,688 --> 00:03:45,288
数千年已经过去
thousands of years have gone. 

44
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:50,244
他们的王国甚至都不在那了 他们说 但是我们只是在那呆了几分钟
Their kingdom was not even there. They said, 
"But we were just there for few minutes. 

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,711
我们只是向梵天神表达了我们的敬意然后就回来了 就是那样
We just paid our respect to Lord 
Brahma and we came back, that’s it."

46
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,555
但是一切都改变了
But everything has changed. 

47
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:04,111
所以 时间的差异是不同的
So, that time difference 
is not the same. 

48
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:13,177
所以 如果一个邪恶的人有着非常重的业力
So, if a wicked person
has very heavy karma, 

49
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:22,600
他们需要花很长时间出生 因为那时业力也起着很大的作用
they will take long time to be born, because 
then also karma plays also a big role, 

50
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:27,733
他们也有可能转世为许多动物物种
they will be also probably incarnated 
in many animal species also. 

51
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:33,177
例如 吃肉的人
For example, people 
which eat meat, you know, 

52
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:37,844
你吃的动物的数量越多 你将再生为那种动物的可能性就越高
the amount of animals which you 
have eaten a lot you will be born that, 

53
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:42,130
因为你的业力朝向着那 然后你会说 是的 我没有杀那个动物
because you have karma towards that. Then 
you will say, "Yes, I have not killed that animal, 

54
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:45,640
我怎么会有朝向那个动物的业力呢 但是你参与了吃它们
how can I have karma towards that animal?" 
But you have participated in eating them. 

55
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,177
接着你退化
Then you degrade, 
you know. 

56
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,644
所以 你的业力的等级也以很多不同的方式作用着
So, your level of karma also works 
in many ways, you know, in many 

57
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:01,533
在很多你已经创造了业力的事情里作用着
things what you have 
created karma about. 

58
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:06,888
所以 对于充满着恩典的人
So, it takes for the 
people which are 

59
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:12,422
他们很容易去达到并且他们很快就会重生
full of Grace, they will take it easy to 
attain and they will be born very quickly. 

60
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,422
但是唯有恩典这才能发生
But this happens only 
when there is Grace. 

61
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:22,977
所以 最低 像我说的 对于一个灵魂要花数百年的时间
So, minimum, like I said, it takes 
hundred years for a soul, 

62
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:27,133
人类的年 一个灵魂才能回归
human years, 
for a soul to be back, 

63
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:33,777
但是这不包括已经自我了悟的灵魂
but this excludes 
the realised souls. 

64
00:05:34,777 --> 00:05:37,866
自我了悟的灵魂可以根据他们的意愿随时来或者走
Realised souls can come 
and go whenever they want. 

65
00:05:38,533 --> 00:05:42,955
他们不受任何这些法则的限制
They are not bound
by any of these laws.
