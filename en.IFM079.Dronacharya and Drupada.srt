1
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:13,733
德罗纳实际上想教训木柱王
Dronacharya, in reality wanted
to teach Drupada, you know,

2
00:00:14,777 --> 00:00:17,288
甚至是
that even being

3
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:21,977
这样一个伟大的国王 你也会轻视你的友谊
such a great king you
disvalue your friendship.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,044
另一方面 如果你知道木柱王和德罗纳的故事
In another part, you see, if you know
the story of Drupada and Dronacharya,

5
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:35,733
你会看到 在德罗纳的头脑中
you will see that in
the mind of Dronacharya,

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,422
他并不自由
he was not free.

7
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:45,200
在他的头脑中 他仍然执着于
In his mind, he
was still attached

8
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:55,066
想要教训木柱王这一想法
and due to wanted to
teach the lesson to Drupada,

9
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:02,222
他想要获得最杰出的箭术
you see, he wanted to have the
best of all archery, you know.

10
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:08,466
所以 在教训他(木柱王)的过程中
So, he wanted to
have the best archer

11
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,377
他想用最好的箭手
in the process
to teach him the lesson.

12
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,333
所以 那份贪婪在那
So, that greed was there,

13
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:21,733
想要更多的贪婪
the greed of wanting
more and more.

14
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:25,644
同时木柱王
And in Drupada,

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,866
即使他是 如何来形容
even if he was in
– how you call it –

16
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,177
无知
ignorance,

17
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:36,733
他很自信
you see, he had faith.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,955
他不知道发生了什么 
He didn’t know what was
happening to him, you know,

19
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,777
因为当你无知时
because when
you are in ignorance,

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,355
你不知道发生了什么 你轻视了你的友谊
you don’t know what is happening
to you. You disvalue your friendship,

21
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:51,510
你变得傲慢 你变得
you become arrogant,
you become

22
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:55,600
虚伪等等 不是吗
hypocrite and so on, no?

23
00:01:56,111 --> 00:01:59,333
但是德罗纳本应该从最佳的位置
But Dronacharya should
have been in the best position

24
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:02,866
去纠正这些 对吗
to rectify that, no?

25
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:05,711
但是德罗纳没有去做
But Dronacharya didn’t.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,066
所以 那就是为什么在那故事里
So, that’s why in that story

27
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:17,755
他表现出贪婪 并且也因为那贪婪他甚至不能
he represents that greed and also
due to that greed he could not even,

28
00:02:18,177 --> 00:02:24,155
当黑公主在宫廷中被羞辱时 他也没有
when Draupadi was insulted
in the court, he could not

29
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:28,044
起身和保护黑公主
get up and defend
Draupadi also.

30
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:32,200
那阻住了他
That stopped him.

31
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:38,533
你瞧 人生中有很多美好的事物
You see, there are many
fine things, you see,

32
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:41,711
常常流经发生
which often go
through life.

33
00:02:42,933 --> 00:02:47,977
一些人吵架 然后下一刻他们又成了最好的朋友
Somebody can shout and the next
moment they are again your best friend.

34
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:50,911
他们忘得非常快 是不是
They forget very
quickly. Isn’t it?

35
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:54,200
然而 有一些人吵架
Whereas, there are some
people who can shout,

36
00:02:55,577 --> 00:02:57,955
可是 他们将怨恨记在了心里
but yet, they keep
the grudge inside.

37
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,644
这就是德罗纳的性格
And this was the
character of Dronacharya.

38
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:09,688
并且这一点在他死之前
And this was reminded
to him by Krishna

39
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,444
奎师那也提醒了 那就是为什么他和持国百子在一起
before he died. That’s why
he was with the Kauravas.

40
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:20,066
他没有和般度五子在一起 否则 那会是截然不同的
He was not with the Pandavas.
Otherwise, it would have been vice versa.

41
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,888
因为他内在的贪欲 他去了那里
Due to that greediness
inside of him, he was there.

42
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,533
所以 那就是为什么在这个故事里 他表现出那永不满足的贪婪
So, that’s why in this story he represents
that greed of never being satisfied,

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,422
永远不够
never being enough.

44
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:44,622
这就是贪婪的品质 当你贪婪于某些东西
This is the quality of greed, you know.
When you have greed for something,

45
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:49,111
你永远不会满足于你所拥有的
you are never satisfied
with what you have.
